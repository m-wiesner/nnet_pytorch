First read the README to install nnet_pytorch. This code is based around kaldi,
pychain, and custom pytorch code for training hybrid HMM-DNN neural networks
for ASR.
  
If you follow the instructions in the main README you can install all the
dependencies.

We have provided our final hindi models, the language model directory we used for
decoding, and a pretrained librispeech model that we used to initialized our
BLSTM models during training.

You will also need to install phonetisaurus. This should be done through kaldi.

kaldi/tools/extras/install_phonetisaurus.sh

The mucs2021 directory contains a full example of how to train our best models
as well as how to decode using the language model available for download. We
are in the process of adding the LM training scripts and hope the model
suffices for now. 

The default recipe recreates the lexicon using available hindi and bengali
lexicons from wikipron. Additioanlly we compiled transliteration pairs manually
for hindi, and via a semi-automatic method based on decoding confusions for
bengali. These lists are provided in local/{hindi,bengali}_english_all. We
have not as of yet provided scripts for the semi-automated method because
it frankly doesn't seem to have worked that well.

Please see mucs2021/README for more information about the default recipe.
